        <li>The WEB: a collection of HTML documents</li>
        <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language - the bases for almost all web pages; it is what glues everything together</li>

        <b>How the Web Works</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
        it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
      </p>

        <b>HTML is made up of:</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>text content: what you see</li>
          <li>markup: what it looks like</li>
          <li> references to other documents: like images & videos </li>
          <li>links to other pages</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>HTML Markup</b>
        <br>
        <br> HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>
        <br>
        <br> Tag Outline:
        (the opening tag)the content(the closing tag)
        <br>
        <br> The b tag adds <b>boldness</b> to the content of the tag
        <br>
        <br> The em tag adds emphasises (<em>italics</em>) to the content of the tag
        <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>HTML Attributes</b>
        <br>
        <br> A tag can have multiple attributes -
        <br>(tag attr='value') content (/tag)
        <br>
        <br> Anchors are used for making links - <a href=”http://www.reddit.com”>Reddit</a> a link to www.reddit.com
        <br>
        <br> Image tags are used for including images
        <!-- <img src=”url’ alt= “text”> -->
        <br>
        <br> The <b><em> src </em></b> in an image tag is the url of the image to download
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><em> alt </em></b> is the text to dispaly if the image fails to open - required - broken request
        <br>
        <br> The image tag is a void tag as it has no content and therefore does not need a closing tag
        <br>
        <br> The <em> br </em> tag is a void tag used to create a line break
        <br>
        <br> The <em> p </em> tag is used to create a paragraph.
        <br>
        <br> HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
        <br> Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
        <br> Inline elements: a_b_br_em__img_span_strong
        <br> Block elements: div_form_p
        <br>

          <b>Web Developement</b>
          <br>
          <br> Three languages of Web Developement are <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, & <b>JavaScript</b>.
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML files are like the structure of your house. Where are the walls placed, what room is your living room, what room is your kitchen, which room is your bedroom?</li>
            <br>
            <li>CSS files are the style of your house. What color is the carpeting, what decorations do you have up, what colors are the walls.</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript files are your interactive components. Think of them as you garage door opener or your television remote. They are changing some element of your house.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <b> The "tree-like structure" of HTML </b>
          <br>
          <br> A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. Computer Sciences use a data structure type tree structure.
          <br>
          <br> A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside
          down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
          <br>
          <br> The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
          <br>
          <br> In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
          <br>
          <br> The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b> Boxes to HTML </b>
          <br>
          <br> When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
          <br>
          <br> The <b>div</b> tab is used to define boxes within a web page.
          <br>
          <!-- <div class="title">My App</div> -->
          <!-- <div class="app"> -->
          <!-- <div class="screenshot">image</div> -->
          <!-- <div class="screenshot">text</div> -->
      </div>

          <b> The Tools Programmers use to Write Code </b>
          <br>
          <br> A text editor is a program that helps you type text similar to document editors, such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, but without all the extra formatting functions that document editors have.
          <br>
          <br> When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening
          tag.
          <br>
          <br> Comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. They are just there so that programmers can leave notes for other people (or themselves) to read.
          <ul>
            <li>In HTML, code comments begin with
              <!-- and end with -->. Everything in between is ignored.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>

        <h2> 1.3 Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            <b> Understanding CSS & Adding Style </b>
            <br>
            <br> CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
            <br> There are three methods to include CSS Styling in a web page.
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Method 1: Write CSS in the

                <head> of your HTML</li>
              <li>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</li>
              <li>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</li>
            </ol </p>
            <p>
              Method 1 is good for very small projects.
              <br>
              <br> Method 2 is best used for larger projects.
              <br>
              <br> Method 3 leads to a lot of repeated code and is therefore a very bad ideal.
              <br>
              <br> You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find (or match, in CSS terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different
              ones.
              <br>
              <br> It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:
              <ul>
                <li>the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)</li>
                <li>stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)</li>
                <li>stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal)</li>
                <li>inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided)</li>
              </ul>
              "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.
              <br> Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements. Because these rules sometime differ between browsers, there are efforts to promote consistency in styles across browsers. One popular solution to this issue is
              using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as normalize.css.
            </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b> CSS Box Model </b>
            <br>
            <br> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term “box model” is used when talking about design and layout.
            <br>
            <br> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Margin - clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent. {the spacing between the boxes on the web page}</li>
              <li>Border – a border that goes around the padding and the content.</li>
              <li>Padding - clears an area around the content. The margin is transparent.</li>
              <li>Content: The content of the box, where text and images appear. {the nucleus protected by the other layers so the web site is more visually appealing.}</li>
            </ul>
            As dwscribed above, the box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
